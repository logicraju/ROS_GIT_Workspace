# Solution - Instructions
#### Note: The task solutions are located within Asimov_Workspace directory.

First, pull the repository. Then, for each terminal goto Asimov_Workspace directory to execute various nodes.

I. Task 1

To run the solution for Task1, do the following:

  a. CPP Solution
  
  - Run roscore in a terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment calc_server in another terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment calc_client in another terminal
  
  b. Python Solution
 
  - Run roscore in a terminal 
  - Run rosrun assignment calc_server_py.py
  - Run rosrun assignment calc_client_py.py
  
II. Task 2

To run the solution for Task2, do the following:

  a. CPP Solution
  
  - Run roscore in a terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment publisher in another terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment subscriber in another terminal
  
  b. Python Solution
  
  - Run roscore in a terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment publisher_py.py in another terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment subscriber_py.py in another terminal
  
  The output files would be present in the workspace directory (Eg: Asimov_Workspace/text1.txt)
  
  III. Task 3
  
  To run the solution for Task3, do the following:

  - Run roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch in a terminal
  - Run rosrun assignment husky_client in another terminal
    (The robot movement can be visualized in gazebo)
